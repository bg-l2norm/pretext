# Current Status

Compact current snapshot for the main browser sweep and benchmark numbers.

Use this file for "where are we right now?".
Use `RESEARCH.md` for why the numbers changed and what was tried.
Use `corpora/STATUS.md` for the long-form corpus canaries.

## Browser Accuracy

Official browser regression sweep:

| Browser | Status |
|---|---|
| Chrome | `7680/7680` |
| Safari | `7680/7680` |
| Firefox | `7680/7680` |

Notes:
- This is the 4-font × 8-size × 8-width × 30-text browser corpus.
- The public accuracy page is effectively a regression gate now, not the main steering metric.
- Current machine-readable accuracy snapshots are checked in as:
  - `accuracy/chrome.json`
  - `accuracy/safari.json`
  - `accuracy/firefox.json`
- These accuracy snapshot files were captured on `2026-03-26`.

## Benchmark Snapshot

Current benchmark snapshots are checked in as:
- `benchmarks/chrome.json`
- `benchmarks/safari.json`

`STATUS.md` stays the compact dashboard. The JSON files are the machine-readable source for the current benchmark numbers.
These snapshot files were captured on `2026-03-26`.

Notes:
- Chrome remains the main maintained performance baseline. Safari snapshots are still useful, but they are noisier and warm up less predictably.
- The checked-in JSON snapshots are cold checker runs. Ad hoc page-driven numbers, especially in Safari, can differ after warmup.
- Refresh the benchmark JSON snapshots when a diff changes benchmark methodology or the text engine's hot path (`src/analysis.ts`, `src/measurement.ts`, `src/line-break.ts`, `src/layout.ts`, `src/bidi.ts`, or `pages/benchmark.ts`).
- `layout()` remains the resize hot path; `prepare()` is where script-specific cost still lives.
- Long-form corpus rows now split `prepare()` into analysis and measurement phases, which makes it easier to tell whether a script is expensive because of segmentation/glue work or because of raw width measurement volume.
